This power stage shall be able to drive a BLDC with approximately 3kW.


+++ Spec/Sizing +++
Supply voltage between 24V and 60V.
Motor current less than 100A peak.
Hall sensor current feedback.
Supply voltage sensing.


+++ Current Sensors +++
Two hall sensors Allegro ACS756SCA-100B.
Measurement range: +/-100A peak.


+++ MOSFET's +++
FDB86135 (100V, 3mOhm)
--> conduction losses < 4W


+++ Supply voltage sensing +++
Voltage divider R13 & R14.
Do not populate R26 & R27 in the power_driver!
R27 may be replaced by a 3.3V zehner to protect the STM32.
